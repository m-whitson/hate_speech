Hate speech on Twitter projects for DS3000 Foundations of Data Science and LING4654 Forensic Linguistics

During the Spring 2021 semester, I did two of my final projects on the same topic. For my seminar in forensic linguistics, I completed discourse analytic research and wrote a linguistics paper on hate speech, particularly how it occurs online. For my data science project (completed with a partner), I worked on creating a classifier for hate speech using Tweets scraped from the Twitter API and then from a labeled dataset of hateful Tweets from Kaggle. These are two distinct projects, but they are informed by the same research and were completed concurrently.
